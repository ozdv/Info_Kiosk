# Informaiton Kiosk
This is a project completed by a group of 5 students apart of a course offered at the University of Calgary, Computer science 481: Human-Computer Interaction.

This is an information kiosk, welcoming newcomers to our city, developed as a C# WPF application. We underwent research, and interviews of newcomers to identify the type of information that would be most beneficial to include. In addition we analyzed the design, and how best to illustrate the information to users.
